It seems 'aclocal' could not find the autoconf macros used to check
for C++ standard's compliance.

These macros are available in the 'autoconf-archive'.  If you have
this archive installed, it is probably installed in a location that
is not searched by default.  In that case, please note this via:

  `autoconf -t AC_INIT:'$3'`

If you haven't installed the 'autoconf-archive', please do so and
rerun:

  $0 $*

If the 'autoconf-archive' is not packaged for your operating system,
you can find the sources at:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/
